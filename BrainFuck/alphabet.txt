to do alphabet from A to Z you need to go from 65 to 90
which is 26

5 times 5 is 25
>
+++ ++ load in first value
[< +++ ++ > -]
<+>
8 times 8 is 64
>
++++ ++++ load in first value
[< ++++ ++++ > -]
<+
now we are at 65 in second position

<
[
>
. output the character
+ increment letter
< move back to alphabet counter
- decrement
]
